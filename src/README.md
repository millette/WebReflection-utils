Each utility can be loaded from a *CDN* via either `https://esm.run/@webreflection/utils/UTILITY` or `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@webreflection/utils/src/UTILITY.js`.


This document describes each utility separately.


## accessor

Wrap a `{ get, set }` descriptor as a single synchronous function. Argument
count selects the operation: call with no arguments to read, or with exactly
one argument to write.

The descriptor may be any object or class instance that defines or inherits
both methods. Extra properties are allowed. `get` takes no parameters and
returns a value. `set` takes exactly one value and may return void. The
returned accessor is synchronous: both `ref()` and `ref(value)` return `T`.

This mirrors `(value = x)` where assignment yields the assigned value. Writes
are `ref(value)` since assignment syntax cannot be expressed via property
descriptors alone.

`get` and `set` are invoked with a `this` context. When the accessor is called
standalone (`ref()`), that context is the descriptor object passed to
`accessor`. When it is assigned to a host and called as a property
(`host.ref()`), the context is the host instead. The same descriptor can
therefore target either its own backing fields or those on another object,
depending on how the returned function is used.

```js
import accessor from '@webreflection/utils/accessor';

// Standalone: `this` in get/set is the descriptor object itself.
const value = accessor({
  value: 42,
  get() {
    return this.value;
  },
  set(next) {
    this.value = next;
  },
});

value();      // 42
value(43);    // 43
value();      // 43
```

When the accessor is installed on a host object, `get` and `set` see that host
as `this` instead:

```js
const object = Object.defineProperty({ _: 42 }, 'value', {
  enumerable: true,
  writable: true,
  value: accessor({
    get() {
      return this._;
    },
    set(next) {
      this._ = next;
    },
  }),
});

object.value();      // 42
object.value(43);    // 43
object.value();      // 43
object._;            // 43
```

In TypeScript, annotate the expected context on `get` / `set` with `@this` in
JSDoc, or with an explicit `this` parameter in `.d.ts` consumers. The context
type can differ between the two patterns above: a standalone accessor usually
types `this` as the descriptor (or a shape it includes), while a host property
accessor types `this` as the host object.


## all

A `Promise.all` companion with one extra convenience: when called with a
single object literal, it resolves each value and returns an object with the
same keys.

```js
import all from '@webreflection/utils/all';

const user = await all({
  name: fetchName(),
  age: fetchAge()
});

// { name: 'Ada', age: 36 }
```

This preserves the shape and names of object-literal work, avoiding the
positional array juggling required by `Promise.all`. For arrays, or for two or
more arguments, it behaves like `Promise.all` and resolves to an array.

To await a single promise, use `await` (or `Promise.resolve`) directly — **all**
is for resolving many values at once, not a substitute for awaiting one promise.


## ascii

An extremely small string to `Uint8Array` converter for known ASCII-compatible
content. It does not validate or encode Unicode code points; it simply stores
each string unit as its `0-255` char code.

This is meant for niche cases where the input is already constrained, such as
ISO date strings, plain-English global names or method names, and other small
ad-hoc values.

```js
import { encode, decode } from '@webreflection/utils/ascii';

console.log(decode(encode('ASCII')));
// ASCII
```

Please note that decoding also fails for inputs bigger than about 64K bytes, or
whatever argument limit your runtime has for `String.fromCharCode`.


## async-accessor

Wrap a `{ get, set }` descriptor as a single async function. Argument count
selects the operation: call with no arguments to read, or with exactly one
argument to write.

The descriptor may be any object or class instance that defines or inherits
both methods. Extra properties are allowed. `get` takes no parameters and may
return a value or a promise. `set` takes exactly one value; its return value
is ignored and may be sync or async. The returned accessor is always async:
both `await ref()` and `await ref(value)` resolve to `T`.

This mirrors `(value = x)` where assignment yields the assigned value. Writes
are `await ref(value)` since assignment syntax cannot be expressed via
property descriptors alone.

`get` and `set` are invoked with a `this` context. When the accessor is called
standalone (`await ref()`), that context is the descriptor object passed to
`asyncAccessor`. When it is assigned to a host and called as a property
(`await host.ref()`), the context is the host instead. The same descriptor can
therefore target either its own backing fields or those on another object,
depending on how the returned function is used.

```js
import asyncAccessor from '@webreflection/utils/async-accessor';

// Standalone: `this` in get/set is the descriptor object itself.
const value = asyncAccessor({
  value: 42,
  async get() {
    return this.value;
  },
  async set(next) {
    this.value = next;
  },
});

await value();      // 42
await value(43);    // 43
await value();      // 43
```

When the accessor is installed on a host object, `get` and `set` see that host
as `this` instead:

```js
const object = Object.defineProperty({ _: 42 }, 'value', {
  enumerable: true,
  writable: true,
  value: asyncAccessor({
    async get() {
      return this._;
    },
    async set(next) {
      this._ = next;
    },
  }),
});

await object.value();      // 42
await object.value(43);    // 43
await object.value();      // 43
object._;                  // 43
```

In TypeScript, annotate the expected context on `get` / `set` with `@this` in
JSDoc, or with an explicit `this` parameter in `.d.ts` consumers. The context
type can differ between the two patterns above: a standalone accessor usually
types `this` as the descriptor (or a shape it includes), while a host property
accessor types `this` as the host object.

## base64

A small async wrapper around `Uint8Array.prototype.toBase64()` and
`Uint8Array.fromBase64()` for encoding and decoding binary data as strings.
Optional compression is applied through `CompressionStream` and
`DecompressionStream` before or after the base64 step.

```js
// if a polyfill is required for older browsers
import '@ungap/base64';

// this module base64 utility
import { encode, decode } from '@webreflection/utils/base64';

const encoded = await encode('Hello, world!');
const decoded = await decode(encoded);

console.log(decoded);
// Hello, world!
```

Pass the same `format` to both sides when the payload should be compressed
first. Supported formats are `brotli`, `gzip`, `deflate`, `deflate-raw`, and
`zstd` [as mentioned on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CompressionStream/CompressionStream#format).

```js
const compressed = await encode('Hello, world!', { format: 'deflate' });
const decompressed = await decode(compressed, { format: 'deflate' });

console.log(decompressed);
// Hello, world!
```

By default, `decode()` returns a UTF-8 string. Pass `{ buffer: true }` to get
the raw `ArrayBuffer` instead.

```js
const buffer = await decode(compressed, { format: 'deflate', buffer: true });

console.log(new Uint8Array(buffer));
// Uint8Array(13) [ 72, 101, 108, 108, 111, 44, 32, 119, 111, 114, 108, 100, 33 ]
```

`encode()` accepts any `BlobPart`, so strings, typed arrays, and `ArrayBuffer`
values all work. Both helpers also accept `alphabet: 'base64url'` and other
options forwarded to the native base64 APIs, such as `omitPadding` on encode and
`lastChunkHandling` on decode.

Use `stream()` when the decoded (and optionally decompressed) payload should stay
a `Response` / readable stream instead of being buffered into a string or
`ArrayBuffer`. The `format` option still drives `DecompressionStream`; `type`
sets the response `Content-Type` (default `application/octet-stream`).

```js
import { encode, stream } from '@webreflection/utils/base64';

const compressed = await encode('Hello, world!', { format: 'deflate' });
const response = await stream(compressed, { format: 'deflate' });

console.log(await response.text());
// Hello, world!
```

`Transformer` is a `TransformStream` that turns base64 text chunks into
`Uint8Array` chunks. Pipe a stream of base64 through it when decoding should
happen incrementally rather than in one shot:

```js
import { encode, Transformer } from '@webreflection/utils/base64';

const encoded = await encode('Hello, world!');
const { body } = await fetch(`data:application/octet-stream,${encoded}`);
const response = new Response(body.pipeThrough(new Transformer));

console.log(await response.text());
// Hello, world!
```

Both `stream` and `Transformer` are also available as standalone subpaths:
`@webreflection/utils/base64/stream` and `@webreflection/utils/base64/transformer`.


## bound-once

This is equivalent to **bound**, except each bound method is created only once. It is useful when bound method identity must be preserved across multiple calls.

This variant uses [sticky](#sticky) to ensure that weakly referenced targets always produce the same bound method within the same realm.


## bound-key

This utility binds one or more functions to a context key and caches the result
per key. It is useful when the same logic should run with different `this`
values — especially in DOM code — without passing that context through every
call.

Pass one or more functions; it returns a matching array of factories. Each
factory accepts a key, binds the function's `this` to that key, and reuses the
same bound function when the key is seen again.

```js
import boundKey from '@webreflection/utils/bound-key';

function greet() {
  return `Hello ${this}!`;
}

const [bound] = boundKey(greet);

const world = bound('world');
world(); // 'Hello world!'
bound('world') === world; // true — cached per key
```

A typical DOM use case:

```js
function handle() {
  this.classList.toggle('active');
}

const [boundHandle] = boundKey(handle);

for (const el of document.querySelectorAll('.item'))
  el.addEventListener('click', boundHandle(el));
```

Unlike [bound](#bound) and [bound-once](#bound-once), which bind methods on an
object target, **bound-key** binds arbitrary functions to any key and keeps one
cached bound function per key.


## bound

This utility provides an object-destructuring syntax shortcut for binding methods.

```js
import bound from '@webreflection/utils/bound';

const { all, resolve } = bound(Promise);
all([1, 2, 3]);
resolve(4);
```

The **bound-once** variant ensures that repeated accesses, such as `boundOnce(Promise).all`, always return the same bound method.


## cache

A temporal `Map` subclass for short-lived memoization. It keeps newly added
entries only until its scheduled cleanup runs, making it useful to reuse
expensive work for repeated access to the same key without keeping the value
around as a long-term cache.

```js
import Cache from '@webreflection/utils/cache';

const users = new Cache;

const loadUser = id => users.getOrInsertComputed(
  id,
  id => fetch(`/users/${id}`).then(response => response.json())
);
```

When the constructor `delay` is omitted, `0`, or less than `0`, cleanup is
queued as a microtask, so same-tick lookups can share the stored value and the
map clears itself before the next task. Pass a positive delay, such as
`new Cache(100)`, to keep entries until a timer removes them instead.

Use `getOrInsert(key, value)` or `getOrInsertComputed(key, callback)` when the
value should only be stored if missing. Use `put(key, value)` for the faster
`cache.get(key) ?? cache.put(key, value)` pattern when duplicate queue entries
are acceptable.


## caller-of

Borrow any function or method so the caller passes `this` explicitly as the
first argument. It is a one-liner over `Function.prototype.call.bind`:

```js
import callerOf from '@webreflection/utils/caller-of';

const hasOwn = callerOf(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty);
hasOwn({ a: 1 }, 'a'); // true

const toString = callerOf(Object.prototype.toString);
toString([]); // '[object Array]'
```

Unlike [bound](#bound), which binds methods to a fixed host object, **caller-of**
keeps `this` free: each call supplies a different `thisArg`. That is useful for
safe borrowed natives (`hasOwnProperty`, `toString`, …) without touching the
target’s prototype chain, and without allocating a new bound function per host.

```js
// equivalent
const hasOwn = Function.prototype.call.bind(Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty);
```


## class

Upgrade an existing instance to a real subclass **without** invoking the base
constructor as `super()`. Pass any constructor `Base` to get a bridge whose
`.prototype` is the same object as `Base.prototype`; then `class Sub extends
custom(Base)` works like a normal class, while `new Sub(target)` only runs
`Object.setPrototypeOf(target, new.target.prototype)` and returns that same
`target`.

This is the same idea as
[`custom-function/factory`](https://github.com/WebReflection/custom-function/tree/main#any-illegal-constructor-custom-functionfactory),
with tighter TypeScript generics so the bridge and `InstanceType` stay aligned.

```js
import custom from '@webreflection/utils/class';

class Strong extends custom(String) {
  constructor(value) {
    super(new String(value));
  }
}

const strong = new Strong('hello');
strong instanceof String;  // true
strong instanceof Strong;  // true
String(strong);            // "hello"
```

Typical use: bases whose constructor is awkward or wrong to re-run on an object
you already have — `Function` (would imply `eval`), DOM element constructors,
boxed primitives, and so on. You keep the original identity and engine shape,
and still get `instanceof`, methods, getters, `super`, and private fields.

```js
import custom from '@webreflection/utils/class';

const Div = custom(HTMLDivElement);

class MyDiv extends Div {
  constructor(...childNodes) {
    super(document.createElement('div'));
    this.append(...childNodes);
  }
}

document.body.appendChild(
  new MyDiv(
    new MyDiv('A'),
    new MyDiv('B', 'C'),
  ),
);
```

Signature: `custom(Base) => Bridge`, where `new Sub(target)` returns
`target` typed as `InstanceType<typeof Base>` after the prototype swap.
[dom-fragment](#dom-fragment) is built on this pattern.


## content

A tiny factory builder for turning markup strings into `DocumentFragment`
instances, where each factory parses in the context of a specific element. The
parsing context is just an element, so any namespace reachable through
`createElementNS` works: HTML, SVG, MathML, and so on.

```js
import content from '@webreflection/utils/content';

const parse = content({
  html: document.createElement('template'),
  svg: document.createElementNS('http://www.w3.org/2000/svg', 'svg')
});

const fragment = parse.html('<div>Hello</div>');
document.body.append(fragment);
```

The passed object maps free-form names to the element whose contents define the
parsing context for that name. The returned object exposes the same keys, each
being a `value => DocumentFragment` factory. A single shared `Range` is reused
across all factories, re-selecting node contents only when the active context
changes, so repeated parsing within the same context stays cheap.

Unlike most DOM utilities here, **content** also accepts an optional second
`document` argument. This is handy in SSR projects where there is no global
`document`, but one can be created with *linkedom*, *jsdom*, or similar and
passed in so the same parsing logic works on the server.

```js
import { parseHTML } from 'linkedom';
import content from '@webreflection/utils/content';

const { document } = parseHTML('<html><body></body></html>');
const parse = content({
  html: document.createElement('template')
}, document);

const fragment = parse.html('<div>Hello</div>');
```

When omitted, the second argument defaults to `globalThis.document`. For the
common HTML and SVG contexts in the browser, see [dom-content](#dom-content).


## dedent

Strip common leading indentation from multiline strings. The utility finds the
first non-empty line, measures its leading whitespace, and removes that same
indentation from every line while leaving everything else unchanged.

It works both as a tagged template and as a plain function on strings. In tag
form, interpolations are joined first via [plain-tag](#plain-tag), then
dedented.

```js
import dedent from '@webreflection/utils/dedent';

console.log(dedent`
  Hello,
  world!
`);
// Hello,
// world!

console.log(dedent(`
  Hello,
  world!
`));
// Hello,
// world!
```

Use the tag form when the string is written inline in source code and should
lose the surrounding indentation. Use the function form when the input is already
a string variable.


## devtools

Short selectors for DOM queries, mirroring the helpers available in browser
DevTools. `$` and `$$` wrap `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll`; `$x`
evaluates an XPath expression and returns matching nodes as an array.

```js
import { $, $$, $x } from '@webreflection/utils/devtools';

const title = $('h1');
const links = $$('a[href]');
const items = $x('//li[@data-id]');
```

Each helper accepts an optional root node. When omitted, it defaults to
`document`, so queries can be scoped to any `Document`, `DocumentFragment`, or
`Element`.


## dom-content

A ready-made [content](#content) instance for the two most common contexts,
exposing `html` and `svg` factories backed by a `<template>` element and an
`<svg>` element respectively.

```js
import { html, svg } from '@webreflection/utils/dom-content';

const layout = html('<section><h1>Title</h1></section>');
const icon = svg('<circle cx="10" cy="10" r="5" />');
```

Each helper parses its markup string in the matching context and returns a
`DocumentFragment` ready to be inserted into the DOM. This module relies on the
global `document`, so it is browser-oriented. For SSR, or when a specific
`Document` or additional parsing contexts are required, use
[content](#content) directly and pass the server-side document as its second
argument.


## dom-diff

Reconcile a live list of DOM nodes against a desired future list, anchored to a
pin node that marks where the list ends in the parent. Entries may be ordinary
`ChildNode`s or persistent fragments from [dom-fragment](#dom-fragment).

```js
import diff from '@webreflection/utils/dom-diff';

const parent = document.querySelector('#list');
const pin = document.createComment('');
parent.append(pin);

let nodes = [];

// insert a, b, c before the pin
nodes = diff(nodes, [a, b, c], pin);

// reorder and drop b
nodes = diff(nodes, [c, a], pin);

// clear the list
nodes = diff(nodes, [], pin);
```

The pin can also be bound once so every later call remembers where to differ:

```js
const update = diff.bind(pin);

nodes = update(nodes, [a, b, c]);
nodes = update(nodes, [c, a]);
nodes = update(nodes, []);
```

Persistent fragments count as a single list entry while their children occupy a
range in the parent. Diff places them via `valueOf()` and then advances the pin
to the fragment’s start marker, so siblings still line up correctly:

```js
import diff from '@webreflection/utils/dom-diff';
import Fragment from '@webreflection/utils/dom-fragment';

const pin = document.body.appendChild(document.createComment(''));
const group = new Fragment(document.createDocumentFragment());
group.append(document.createElement('div'), document.createElement('div'));

let nodes = [];
nodes = diff(nodes, [hr1, group, hr2], pin);
nodes = diff(nodes, [group, hr2], pin); // drop hr1, keep the group range
```

Signature: `diff(current, future, pin?) => future` — pass `pin` each time, or
omit it after `diff.bind(pin)`.

- nodes present in `current` but missing from `future` are removed — skipped
  entirely when `current` and `future` are the same array reference (in-place
  mutate / reorder only needs placement)
- nodes in `future` are walked right-to-left and placed so each ends up
  immediately before the pin (then the pin advances), producing the future
  order as consecutive siblings ending at the original pin
- for a persistent fragment (`nodeType === 11`), placement uses
  `pin.before(node.valueOf())` and the pin becomes `node.firstChild` (the start
  comment); for a normal node, the pin becomes that node
- when the pin is connected and a normal node already lives under the same
  parent, `parentNode.moveBefore` is preferred so state is preserved; otherwise
  `pin.before(...)` inserts or re-homes the entry (including fragments)
- returns `future` so the caller can keep that array as the next `current`

Requires a DOM parent on `pin.parentNode`, and a pin that supports `before`
(any `ChildNode`). Useful for keyed list updates where you already hold node
identity — including multi-node groups via [dom-fragment](#dom-fragment) — and
only need remove / insert / reorder.


## dom-fragment

A `DocumentFragment` subclass (via [class](#class)) that keeps a live range in
the tree instead of dissolving on insert. Construct with an existing fragment;
`super` swaps its prototype onto the subclass without re-running
`DocumentFragment` as a constructor, so the same object becomes
`instanceof Fragment` while remaining a real fragment.

The instance wraps content between stable `<>` / `</>` comment markers
(`firstChild` / `lastChild`). Once placed in a parent, that range can be moved,
removed, or replaced as one unit. Designed as a single entry in
[dom-diff](#dom-diff) lists.

```js
import Fragment from '@webreflection/utils/dom-fragment';

const pin = document.body.appendChild(document.createComment(''));
const fragment = document.createDocumentFragment();
fragment.append(
  document.createElement('li'),
  document.createElement('li'),
);

// guards fragment childNodes via surrounding comments
const group = new Fragment(document.createDocumentFragment());

// markers + children land before `pin`; `group` remains the handle
pin.before(group);
group.remove(); // drops everything from the start marker through the end marker
```

Signature: `new Fragment(documentFragment)`.

The constructed instance is the same fragment object, with:

- `firstChild` / `lastChild` — comment markers that bound the live range
- `parentNode` — the parent of the start marker when the range is in the tree
- `before(...nodes)` — insert before the start marker
- `remove()` — delete the range (markers and everything between) from the parent
- `replaceWith(node)` — replace the whole range with a single node
- `valueOf()` — if children are live under a parent, gather the range back into
  the fragment and return it, so a later insert moves the group again

Use this when a list item is logically one entry but renders as several nodes
(a view “block”, a row with multiple cells, and so on). Pair it with
[dom-diff](#dom-diff) so the group participates in reconcile like any other
node. Requires a DOM (`document`, `Range`, comments).


## dom-observer

Shared browser helper that runs one document-wide `MutationObserver` and lets
any number of subscribers react to added or removed nodes. The first import in
the realm (via [sticky](#sticky)) starts observing `document` with
`{ childList: true, subtree: true }` and patches `Element.prototype.attachShadow`
so every new shadow root is observed too. Later copies of the module — for
example after re-bundling — reuse the same `subscribers` and `shadows` and skip
setup, so there is only one observer and one `attachShadow` patch per realm.

Requires a DOM (`document`, `MutationObserver`, `Element`). In Node, provide one
(e.g. linkedom) or do not import this entry.

```js
import { subscribers, shadows } from '@webreflection/utils/dom-observer';

subscribers.add(mutations => {
  for (const { addedNodes, removedNodes } of mutations) {
    // react to tree changes, including inside shadow roots
  }
});

// later
const host = document.querySelector('my-element');
const root = shadows.get(host); // ShadowRoot attached after this module loaded
```

Exports:

- `subscribers` — a `Set` of `(mutations: MutationRecord[]) => void` callbacks.
  Add your listener once; every mutation batch is forwarded to all subscribers
- `shadows` — a `WeakMap` from host `Node` to the `ShadowRoot` created via the
  patched `attachShadow`, including closed roots that are otherwise unreachable

Use this when several features need the same add/remove notifications without
each spinning up its own observer or `attachShadow` patch. Prefer importing it
as early as possible so shadow roots attached before the first sticky install are
not missed. [dom-signals](#dom-signals) is built on top of this module.


## dom-signals

Browser companion to [signals](#signals): the same minimal core, plus explicit
`subscribe` / `unsubscribe` helpers that bind a callback to both a DOM node and
a signal.

Built on [dom-observer](#dom-observer): importing this entry registers one
subscriber on the shared observer (and therefore inherits its sticky
once-per-realm document-wide watch plus `attachShadow` patch). Associations are
stored in a `WeakMap`, so a node that becomes unreachable can be garbage
collected without leaving signal subscriptions behind. Subtree walks also follow
shadow roots recorded in `shadows`, so nodes inside open or closed shadow DOM
pause and resume with their host.

```js
import {
  signal,
  computed,
  batch,
  subscribe,
  unsubscribe,
} from '@webreflection/utils/dom-signals';

const text = signal('test');
const num = signal(0);

// note: mandatory tracking of signals relevant for this computed
const label = computed(() => `${text.value} ${num.value}`, [text, num]);

const app = document.querySelector('#app');

const sync = subscribe(app, label, () => {
  app.textContent = label.value;
});

// apply the returned callback directly
// if the dom node is already live
if (app.isConnected) sync();

batch(() => {
  text.value = 'test2';
  num.value = 1;
});

// later, drop the association explicitly if the node stays in the tree
unsubscribe(app, label, sync);
```

`subscribe(node, signal, callback)` registers `callback` on `signal` immediately
and remembers the pair on `node`. `unsubscribe` removes that pair and deletes
the callback from the signal.

Lifecycle is automatic when nodes move in or out of the tree (light DOM or
shadow):

- **disconnected** — the observer walks the removed subtree and `delete`s every
  associated callback from its signal, so detached UI stops reacting and does
  not keep signals alive
- **reconnected** — the observer walks the added subtree, `add`s those callbacks
  again, and invokes each one once so the node refreshes against the current
  value

You still choose what to subscribe; the observer only keeps those explicit
bindings in sync with DOM attachment. Prefer this entry over importing
[signals](#signals) alone when the app runs in the browser and updates should
follow node lifetime. For custom add/remove handling without signals, use
[dom-observer](#dom-observer) directly. For arbitrary objects or symbols (no DOM
lifecycle), use [ref-signals](#ref-signals). For object-shaped reactive state
with property syntax, use [state-signals](#state-signals) (its own
`subscribe` / `unsubscribe` take a property key). For environments without a
`document`, use [signals](#signals) or [ref-signals](#ref-signals) directly.


## empty

Frozen, shared empty references for code that needs a guaranteed-empty array,
plain object, or null-prototype object without allocating a new one each time.

```js
import { array, object, nil } from '@webreflection/utils/empty';

const defaults = { ...object, theme: 'light' };
const items = [...array, 'new'];
```

- `array` — a frozen, shared empty array (`readonly never[]`)
- `object` — a frozen, shared empty object (`Readonly<Record<string, never>>`)
- `nil` — a frozen, shared empty object with a `null` prototype


## fetch

A drop-in `fetch` proxy that keeps the usual `Promise<Response>` behavior while
also exposing Response fields directly as thenables on the returned promise.

Promise methods (`then`, `catch`, `finally`) forward to the underlying promise,
so `await fetch(url)` and `fetch(url).then(...)` still yield a `Response`.
Body and clone methods (`text`, `json`, `arrayBuffer`, `blob`, `bytes`,
`formData`, `clone`) are invoked automatically when accessed: if `response.ok`
is false they reject with that Response, otherwise they resolve to the method
result. Other Response properties (`status`, `ok`, `headers`, ...) resolve to
the property value.

```js
import fetch from '@webreflection/utils/fetch';

// still a normal Response promise
const ok = await fetch(location.href).then(r => r.ok);

// Response properties as thenables
const status = await fetch(location.href).status;

// body readers are auto-invoked (no `.text()` call)
const html = await fetch(location.href).text;

// non-OK responses reject with the Response when reading a body
try {
  await fetch('/missing').json;
} catch (response) {
  console.log(response.status); // 404
}
```


## global

A lazily trapped view of `globalThis` for pages that must keep using native
constructors, prototypes, and utilities even when other scripts try to replace
or pollute them.

Import this module as early as possible — ideally before any third-party code
runs — then read the globals you need through it instead of from `globalThis`
directly. Each property is snapshotted on first access. Non-null objects are
trapped recursively, so once `Object.prototype.toString` (or any other nested
reference) is retrieved, later reassignment or prototype pollution on the live
global no longer affects the trapped copy.

```js
import global from '@webreflection/utils/global';

const { Object: { prototype: { toString } } } = global;

// later, a hostile script mutates the live global
Object.prototype.toString = function () { return 'polluted'; };
globalThis.Object = function Object() {};

toString.call([]);              // still the native result
toString !== Object.prototype.toString; // true — trapped copy is reliable
globalThis.Object !== global.Object;    // true — constructor was trapped first
```

This is deliberately niche: it does not sandbox code, block execution, or trap
every global up front. It only protects the specific properties already read
through this export, at the time they were first read. Destructure or access
everything you rely on early, and load this module before untrusted scripts
when that guarantee matters.


## has-own

A quick and simple polyfill for `Object.hasOwn()` on older browsers. When the
native method is available, it is used directly; otherwise it falls back to
`Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call`.

```js
import hasOwn from '@webreflection/utils/has-own';

console.log(hasOwn({ a: 1 }, 'a'));
// true
```


## id

A tiny factory for unique `int32` identifiers. Each call to the returned function
yields the next value, and the counter wraps automatically from `2 ** 31 - 1` to
`-2 ** 31` so it can roundtrip forever without growing past signed 32-bit range.

```js
import id from '@webreflection/utils/id';

const next = id();

console.log(next()); // 0
console.log(next()); // 1

const roundtrip = id(2 ** 31 - 1);

console.log(roundtrip()); // 2147483647
console.log(roundtrip()); // -2147483648
```

Pass an optional starting value when the first issued id should not be `0`.


## instance-of

Return the first constructor in a list that matches `ref` via `instanceof`, so
`switch`/`case` can dispatch on types without the `switch (true)` workaround.

```js
import instanceOf from '@webreflection/utils/instance-of';

const types = [Response, Request, Headers];

const kind = instanceOf(ref, types);

switch (kind) {
  case Response:
    // ...
    break;
  case Request:
    // ...
    break;
  case Headers:
    // ...
    break;
  case Array:
    // arrays that did not match any listed constructor
    break;
  case Object:
    // plain objects that did not match any listed constructor
    break;
}
```

`ref` must be a non-null object (`typeof ref === 'object' && ref !== null`).
Constructors are checked in list order; the first match wins. When none match,
the result is `Array` for arrays and `Object` otherwise, so both defaults can
be handled explicitly in the same `switch`.


## iterable

Ensures an object can be consumed by `for...of`, spread, `Array.from`, and
other iterable-aware APIs.

```js
import iterable from '@webreflection/utils/iterable';

const query = iterable({ page: 1, perPage: 20 });

console.log([...query]);
// [['page', 1], ['perPage', 20]]
```

If the object already defines or inherits `Symbol.iterator`, it is returned
unchanged. Otherwise, the same object receives a configurable own
`Symbol.iterator` method that yields `Object.entries(ref)`.


## json-callback

Return a callback's source string for JSON payloads. Arrow functions and
`function` declarations or expressions are left as-is; method shorthand is
normalized to named `function` form so the result can be revived later.

```js
import toJSONCallback from '@webreflection/utils/json-callback';

console.log(toJSONCallback(() => {}));
// () => {}

console.log(toJSONCallback({ f() {} }.f));
// function f() {}
```


## json-storage

A small *Map* like facade over `localStorage` by default, or `sessionStorage`
when requested. Values are serialized with `JSON.stringify` on write and parsed
with `JSON.parse` on read, so callers can store structured data without
manually converting every value.

```js
import JSONStorage from '@webreflection/utils/json-storage';

const preferences = new JSONStorage;

preferences.set('theme', { dark: true });

console.log(preferences.get('theme').dark);
// true
```

The API follows familiar `Map` names where they make sense: `get`, `set`,
`has`, `delete`, `clear`, `entries`, `keys`, `values`, and default iteration.
Missing keys return `undefined`, while `delete(key)` reports whether the key was
present.

```js
const cart = new JSONStorage(JSONStorage.SESSION);

const items = cart.getOrInsert('items', []);
items.push('book');
cart.set('items', items);

for (const [key, value] of cart) {
  console.log(key, value);
}
```

Use `getOrInsert(key, value)` to create a value only when the key is absent, or
`getOrInsertComputed(key, callback)` when the initial value should be computed
from the key. A second constructor argument can replace the native *JSON* API as
long as it provides compatible `parse(source)` and `stringify(value)` methods.

Store JSON-serializable values that `stringify` turns into a string. `null` is
fine (`JSON.stringify(null)` is `"null"`). If `stringify` returns `null` or
`undefined` (as default *JSON* does for `undefined`), `set` / `put` remove the
key instead of writing — so a later `get` is `undefined` and `has` is `false`.


## libwabt

A drop-in bootstrap of the original
[`libwabt.js`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt) from the WebAssembly Binary
Toolkit. No *npm* package tracks the latest demo build, so this wrapper
re-packages the files WABT already publishes after its Emscripten demo build.
The WASM binary is shipped as a compressed base64 payload and decoded at
runtime, so there is nothing extra to fetch, land on disk, or compile by hand.

The default export is async: it instantiates the module and returns the same
`parseWat` / `readWasm` API as upstream. From there WAT can be compiled to WASM,
WASM can be printed back as WAT, modules can be validated, and the resulting
binary can be instantiated for tests.

```js
import libwabt from '@webreflection/utils/libwabt';

const wabt = await libwabt();

const wat = wabt.parseWat(
  'add.wat',
  `(module
    (func (export "add") (param i32 i32) (result i32)
      local.get 0
      local.get 1
      i32.add))`
);

wat.validate();

const { buffer } = wat.toBinary({ log: true, write_debug_names: true });
const { instance: { exports } } = await WebAssembly.instantiate(buffer);
exports.add(1, 2); // 3
wat.destroy();

const wasm = wabt.readWasm(buffer, { readDebugNames: true });
console.log(wasm.toText({ foldExprs: false, inlineExport: false }));
wasm.destroy();
```

Any extra argument is forwarded to the upstream loader except `locateFile`,
which this wrapper owns so the inlined binary is used. Call `destroy()` on each
parsed module when it is no longer needed. Upstream files keep their original
[Apache 2.0](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/blob/main/LICENSE) license and
credits.


## map

A native `Map` subclass with one extra method: `put(key, value)`. It stores the
entry like `set`, but returns the value instead of the map reference itself.

```js
import Map from '@webreflection/utils/map';

const map = new Map;

const value = map.put('theme', { dark: true });

console.log(value.dark);
// true
```

Use `set` when chaining on the map is needed; use `put` when the stored value
should flow directly into the next expression.


## plain-tag

Transform a generic tagged template function into a plain string by
interpolating the static parts and values, without any special handling or
escaping.

```js
import plainTag from '@webreflection/utils/plain-tag';

console.log(plainTag`Hello, ${'world'}!`);
// Hello, world!
```


## python-tag

Bootstrap a [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/) or
[MicroPython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/tree/master/ports/webassembly)
WASM interpreter and return a runner that executes Python with the least
ceremony. The default export is async: it dynamically imports the module URL,
prefers `loadMicroPython` when present, otherwise calls `loadPyodide`, and
forwards any extra arguments to that loader. The resolved value is the runner;
the underlying instance is also available as `.interpreter`.

```js
import pythonTag from '@webreflection/utils/python-tag';

// Pyodide (default module URL is https://esm.run/pyodide)
const py = await pythonTag();

// or pin a CDN build / use MicroPython instead
// const py = await pythonTag('https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/pyodide/v0.28.0/full/pyodide.mjs');
// const py = await pythonTag(micropythonURL, { url: wasmURL });
```

Code is always [dedent](#dedent)ed after [plain-tag](#plain-tag) interpolation.
The last expression's value is returned (same as Pyodide's `runPython` /
`runPythonAsync`).

### Template literal (async, default)

Tagged use runs via `runPythonAsync`, so top-level `await` works and the result
is a promise:

```js
const result = await py`
  print('Hello, world!')
  1 + 2
`;
// 3
```

### String + optional options

Pass a code string, and optionally an options object shaped like
[Pyodide's `runPython` options](https://pyodide.org/en/stable/usage/api/js-api.html#pyodide.runPython)
(`globals`, `locals`, `filename`, …). This utility also accepts `sync: true`,
which selects synchronous `runPython` instead of `runPythonAsync` and is
stripped before the call. MicroPython's WASM runner takes the code only, so
fields like `globals` are ignored; `sync` remains handled here.

```js
await py(`print(123)`);
// async via runPythonAsync

py(`print(123)`, { sync: true });
// sync via runPython

const globals = py.interpreter.toPy({ test: true });
await py(`'test' in globals() and globals()['test']`, { globals });
// true
```

### Bound options tag

Pass only the options object to get a template tag that reuses those options on
every invoke (including a persistent `sync: true`):

```js
const syncPy = py({ sync: true });
syncPy`1 + 2`;
// 3 (not a Promise)

const withGlobals = py({ globals });
await withGlobals`'test' in globals()`;
// true
```


## ref-id

Assigns a unique `int32` identifier to any WeakMap-compatible key (object or
symbol). The same reference always gets the same id; different references get
different ids. Values come from [id](#id), so they stay in signed 32-bit range
and wrap forever without growing past `Int32Array` limits.

```js
import refId from '@webreflection/utils/ref-id';

const a = {};
const b = {};

console.log(refId(a)); // e.g. 0
console.log(refId(a)); // same id as above
console.log(refId(b)); // a different id
console.log(refId(globalThis) === refId(globalThis)); // true
```

Ids are held weakly: when a key is garbage-collected, its id can be reused for
a later key. Use this when you need a compact numeric handle for an object or
symbol without attaching an own property.


## ref-signals

Companion to [signals](#signals): the same minimal core, plus explicit
`subscribe` / `unsubscribe` helpers that bind a callback to both a
WeakMap-compatible key (`WeakKey`: object or symbol) and a signal.

Associations are tracked by [ref-id](#ref-id) and cleaned up through a
`FinalizationRegistry`: when the ref becomes unreachable and is garbage
collected, every callback registered for that ref is deleted from its signal.
There is no reconnect path — once the ref is gone, the subscriptions are gone.

```js
import {
  signal,
  computed,
  batch,
  subscribe,
  unsubscribe,
} from '@webreflection/utils/ref-signals';

const num = signal(0);
const ref = { value: num.value };

const sync = subscribe(ref, num, () => {
  ref.value = num.value;
});

num.value = 1;
// sync ran; ref.value === 1

// drop the association explicitly while the ref is still live
unsubscribe(ref, num, sync);
```

`subscribe(ref, signal, callback)` registers `callback` on `signal` immediately
and remembers the pair under `ref`. `unsubscribe` removes that pair and deletes
the callback from the signal. Prefer this entry over importing
[signals](#signals) alone when subscriptions should die with an arbitrary
object or symbol. For DOM nodes that should also pause and resume with
attachment, use [dom-signals](#dom-signals) instead. For object-shaped reactive
state with property syntax, use [state-signals](#state-signals) (its own
`subscribe` / `unsubscribe` take a property key).


## registry

A `Map` subclass that validates keys and values before storing them. By default,
keys are permanent: setting the same key twice throws a `TypeError`, and
deleting an existing key also throws so it cannot be re-appended later. Pass
`unique: false` when replacement and deletion should behave like a regular
`Map`.

```js
import Registry from '@webreflection/utils/registry';

const registry = new Registry(null, {
  key: value => typeof value === 'string',
  value: value => typeof value === 'function'
});

registry.set('ready', () => true);

console.log(registry.get('ready')());
// true
```

Both validators receive the candidate value and should return whether it is
allowed. In TypeScript-aware editors, type-predicate validators also define the
resulting `Registry<Key, Value>` shape, so `key` controls the map key type and
`value` controls the stored value type.

```js
const mutable = new Registry(
  [
    ['answer', 41],
    ['answer', 42]
  ],
  {
    key: value => value === 'answer',
    value: value => Number.isInteger(value),
    unique: false
  }
);

console.log(mutable.get('answer'));
// 42

console.log(mutable.delete('answer'));
// true
```

Initial iterable entries are validated with the same rules used by `set()`, so
invalid keys, invalid values, or duplicate keys fail during construction. With
the default `unique: true` behavior, only missing keys can be passed to
`delete()` without throwing, in which case it returns `false` like `Map`.


## set

A native `Set` subclass with one extra method: `put(value)`. It stores the entry
like `add`, but returns the value instead of the set reference itself.

```js
import Set from '@webreflection/utils/set';

const set = new Set;

const value = set.put('ready');

console.log(value);
// 'ready'
```

Use `add` when chaining on the set is needed; use `put` when the stored value
should flow directly into the next expression.


## shared-array-buffer

This utility provides an unobtrusive *SAB* (*SharedArrayBuffer*) shim based on the default *ArrayBuffer*, with `grow(length)` and `growable` additions.

This class can be used to simulate *SAB* capabilities.

The module exports both `SharedArrayBuffer` and `native`. The `native` *boolean* indicates whether the returned constructor is the platform implementation or the shim.


## signals

A minimalistic, explicit signals implementation. There is no automatic
dependency tracking: every `computed` and `effect` takes the list of signals it
depends on. That keeps the runtime small and the dataflow obvious at the call
site.

`signal(value)` always creates a non-eager signal: writes notify subscribers
only when the new value is not `Object.is`-equal to the previous one.
Same-value writes are no-ops, so dependents (including `computed` and
`effect`) do not re-run. When every write should notify instead — useful for
instrumentation, or whenever identity equality is the wrong gate — construct
an eager signal explicitly with `new Signal(value, true)`.

```js
import {
  Signal,
  signal,
  computed,
  batch,
  effect,
  dispose,
} from '@webreflection/utils/signals';

const a = signal(1);
const b = signal(2);
const c = computed(() => a.value + b.value, [a, b]);

c.value; // 3

a.value = 3;
c.value; // 5

a.value = 3; // Object.is-equal — no notify, c does not recompute

batch(() => {
  a.value = 4;
  batch(() => {
    b.value = 5;
  });
});
c.value; // 9 — recomputed once after the outer batch

// eager only via the class — notify on every write, even when unchanged
const ticks = new Signal(0, true);
ticks.value = 0; // still notifies

const stop = effect(() => {
  const id = setInterval(() => console.log(c.value), 1000);
  return () => clearInterval(id); // runs before the next effect, and on stop()
}, [c]);

a.value = 5; // previous interval cleared, effect runs again
stop();      // unsubscribe and run the last cleanup
c[dispose]();
a[dispose]();
b[dispose]();
```

API surface:

- `signal(value)` — readable and writable `.value`; creates a non-eager
  signal so subscribers run when the new value is not `Object.is`-equal to the
  previous one (or once after an outer `batch`)
- `new Signal(value, eager)` — same `.value` API; pass `true` for an eager
  signal that notifies on every write. Prefer `signal(value)` unless you need
  that behavior
- `computed(fn, signals)` / `Computed` — readonly `.value`, recomputed when any
  listed signal notifies; the dependency list is mandatory. A same-value write
  on a source does not recompute. When a source *does* notify, dependents of the
  computed still run even if `fn`'s result is unchanged (`Computed` uses an
  eager parent signal internally — an implementation detail)
- `batch(fn)` — coalesces nested updates so dependent work runs once afterward
- `effect(fn, signals)` — runs `fn` immediately and again when any listed signal
  notifies; `fn` may return a cleanup, which runs before the next `fn` and again
  when the returned dispose function unsubscribes
- `dispose` — re-exported from `@webreflection/utils/patch/dispose`; call
  `ref[dispose]()` to clear subscribers (`Signal`) or detach from sources
  (`Computed`)

Nested `batch` calls rely on `Set.prototype.union`. Engines that do not ship it
yet need a one-time import of `@webreflection/utils/patch/set-union` before
using signals (or [dom-signals](#dom-signals) / [ref-signals](#ref-signals) /
[state-signals](#state-signals)).

`Signal#add` / `Signal#delete` are available when a custom subscriber is needed.
For DOM nodes that should react while attached and drop listeners when removed
(or resume when reinserted), use [dom-signals](#dom-signals). For raw
add/remove notifications without signal bindings, use [dom-observer](#dom-observer).
For arbitrary objects or symbols whose subscriptions should end when the key is
collected, use [ref-signals](#ref-signals). For plain objects whose fields should
read and write like ordinary properties while staying reactive, use
[state-signals](#state-signals).


## state-signals

Companion to [signals](#signals): the same minimal core, plus helpers that turn
a plain object into reactive state, and explicit `subscribe` / `unsubscribe`
helpers that bind a callback to a state key (like [dom-signals](#dom-signals)
and [ref-signals](#ref-signals), but keyed by property name instead of a DOM
node or WeakKey).

Each data property becomes a signal-backed accessor — reads return the current
value, writes update the underlying signal — so call sites can use ordinary
property syntax instead of `.value`.

```js
import {
  signal,
  computed,
  create,
  update,
  raw,
  subscribe,
  unsubscribe,
  dispose,
  Signal,
  Computed,
} from '@webreflection/utils/state-signals';

const count = signal(0);
const label = computed(() => `n=${count.value}`, [count]);

const state = create({
  count,
  label,
  name: 'John',
  get whole() {
    return `${this.name} is ${this.count}`;
  },
});

state.whole; // 'John is 0'
state.name;  // 'John'

const sync = subscribe(state, 'count', () => {
  // react to state.count changes
});

update(state, { count: 1, name: 'Jane' });
state.whole; // 'Jane is 1'
state.label; // 'n=1'

unsubscribe(state, 'count', sync);

raw(state, 'count') instanceof Signal;   // true
raw(state, 'whole') instanceof Computed; // true

// tear down signals create() allocated (not ones reused from the input)
state[dispose]();

// or, where Symbol.dispose is available, let `using` dispose at block end:
// {
//   using scoped = create({ name: 'temp' });
//   scoped.name; // 'temp'
// }
```

API surface beyond [signals](#signals):

- `create(object)` — returns a `State` with the same keys (`Created<T>` in
  TypeScript). Plain values become new signals; existing `Signal` or `Computed`
  instances are reused (`Computed` properties have no setter). TS unwraps
  those fields to their `.value` types, and the result is a `State` so `raw` /
  `update` / `subscribe` / `dispose` accept it without casts. Own getter-only
  accessors become lazy `Computed` values that depend on every signal already
  present when first read (typically all data properties). Accessors that
  define both `get` and `set` are left unchanged
- `update(state, partial)` — assigns the partial onto `state` inside one
  `batch`, so dependents run once after all listed keys are written
- `raw(state, key)` — returns the underlying `Signal` or `Computed` for that
  key (touching the key first so lazy getter-only computeds initialize). Use
  this when you need the signal instance itself (for example wiring a field
  through [dom-signals](#dom-signals) or [ref-signals](#ref-signals))
- `subscribe(state, key, callback)` — registers `callback` on the underlying
  signal for `key` (via `raw`) and returns that callback
- `unsubscribe(state, key, callback)` — removes that callback from the
  underlying signal for `key`; returns whether it was present
- `dispose` — same re-export as [signals](#signals); call `state[dispose]()` to
  dispose every signal or computed that `create` allocated for that state
  (reused input `Signal` / `Computed` instances are left alone). Because the
  method is keyed by `Symbol.dispose` when the engine provides it, a state can
  also be disposed automatically via the ECMAScript `using` declaration

Prefer this entry when object-shaped state and property syntax are a better fit
than holding individual signal references. Nested `batch` still needs
`Set.prototype.union` (or `@webreflection/utils/patch/set-union`) as with
[signals](#signals).


## sticky

Based on `Symbol.for(name)`, this utility helps modules that might be embedded multiple times across projects avoid conflicts in their internal logic. It preserves the assumption that a module is imported only *once* per application.

```js
import sticky from '@webreflection/utils/sticky';

// will be created and discarded ASAP
// if embedded multiple times
const computed = new WeakMap;

// module will always point at the very first computed
const [module, known] = sticky(
  '@my-project/known-references',
  ref => {
    // ensure this reference is processed only once in this realm
    if (computed.has(ref)) return computed.get(ref);

    // compute the value once, then reuse it on future calls
    const costlyComputation = somethingNeededOnce(ref);
    computed.set(ref, costlyComputation);
    return costlyComputation;
  },
);

if (known) console.warn('embedded multiple times');

export default module;
```

Because the sticky logic is intentionally simple, using a "*first come, first served*" global symbol lookup, avoid storing sensitive values there directly when secrecy or module-level isolation matters.


## weak

A convenience entry that re-exports both [weakmap](#weakmap) and
[weakset](#weakset) when both are needed from a single import.

```js
import { WeakMap, WeakSet } from '@webreflection/utils/weak';

const map = new WeakMap;
const set = new WeakSet;
```


## weakmap

A native `WeakMap` subclass with one extra method: `put(key, value)`. It stores
the entry like `set`, but returns the value instead of the map reference itself.

Also available as `@webreflection/utils/weak-map` — the dash is the only
difference; both paths resolve to the same module.

```js
import WeakMap from '@webreflection/utils/weakmap';
// or: import WeakMap from '@webreflection/utils/weak-map';

const map = new WeakMap;
const key = {};

const value = map.put(key, { ready: true });

console.log(value.ready);
// true
```

Use `set` when chaining on the map is needed; use `put` when the stored value
should flow directly into the next expression. Keys must be objects or symbols,
like the native `WeakMap`.


## weakset

A native `WeakSet` subclass with one extra method: `put(value)`. It stores the
entry like `add`, but returns the value instead of the set reference itself.

Also available as `@webreflection/utils/weak-set` — the dash is the only
difference; both paths resolve to the same module.

```js
import WeakSet from '@webreflection/utils/weakset';
// or: import WeakSet from '@webreflection/utils/weak-set';

const set = new WeakSet;
const item = {};

const value = set.put(item);

console.log(value === item);
// true
```

Use `add` when chaining on the set is needed; use `put` when the stored value
should flow directly into the next expression. Values must be objects or
symbols, like the native `WeakSet`.


## with-resolvers

This utility returns a self-bound `Promise.withResolvers()` implementation that also works on older Android WebView runtimes.

```js
import withResolvers from '@webreflection/utils/with-resolvers';

const { promise, resolve, reject } = withResolvers();

setTimeout(resolve, 0, 42);

export default promise;
```
